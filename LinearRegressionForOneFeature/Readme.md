##### This project implements Linear regression curve fitting and model creation for a dataset of one feature using Gradient Descent implementation and Scikit-Learn

Will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food chain truck. For a restaurant franchise are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and have data for profits and populations from the cities.

The same Algorithm can be used to predict any data by creating best model using Gradient Descent.
